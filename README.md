# Predicting-COVID-19-distribution
 Predicting COVID-19 distribution in Morocco through a Markov chain and SIR model.
In this project, we take advantage of optimization tools as well as a published study (« Predicting COVID-19 distribution in Mexico through a discrete and timedependent Markov chain and an SIR-like model. »)concerning the spread of the COVID 19 virus in Mexico with a view to projecting it and reproduce it for the case of Morocco.
